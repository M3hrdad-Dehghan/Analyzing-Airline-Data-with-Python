## About the Project

In this video, we dive into descriptive statistics as the first step in understanding data science projects. We'll cover how to analyze data from an airline dataset using Python, focusing on key statistical measures like mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation. Learn how to handle outliers using trimming techniques, interpret distribution shapes, and perform basic correlation analysis.
